# T5UIC1
## 1 Overview
The T5UIC1 is a UART based screen based on the DWIN T5 CPU. The T5UIC1 only has a single T5 CPU core and uses a unique reduced instruction set. It is best suited for low-cost applications that do not require a touchscreen or complex UI functions.

**Display features:**
* 65k color TFT display (RGB565)
* Basic drawing commands (rectangle, lines, dots)
* Chinese and ASCII text display as well as the ability to display formatted numeric variables
* JPEG icon and image decoding and display
* EAN-13 barcode generation and QR code generation
* 384kb storage for fonts
    * 6x12 to 32x64 dot matrix ASCII characters and 12x12 to 64x64 dot matrix GB2312 character library
* 512kb storage for images and icons. (Divided into 16 banks of 32kb. Single image cannot exceed 32kb)
    * Divided into 16 banks of 32kb.
    * Can store 16 JPEG images, not exceeding 32kb each.
    * Can store up to 16 JPEG icon library files. (A single library file can occupy multiple banks)
* 32kb of SRAM, for user specified data.
    * Can be read and written to during runtime. Initialized to `0` on boot.
    * Useful for uploading new pictures during runtime.
* 16kb flash memory, for user specified data.
    * Can be read and written to during runtime. Contents persist between reboots.
    * 100,000 write cycles.
    * Useful for persistent configuration options.
* MicroSD/SDHC slot for firmware, fonts & image updates.
* An additional full-duplex serial port that can be controlled through UART.
    * Useful for daisy chaining peripherals to the display on processors with a single UART line.
* Adjustable CPU clock (240MHz and 400MHz)

## 2 UART instruction set
The device has a configurable baud-rate. The baud-rate is configured through the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`.

The serial port is always in **8N1** mode.

### 2.1 Color format
All colors are in the 16 bit **RGB565** format.
**16 Bits:**
| 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9  | 8  | 7  | 6  | 5  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 0  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| R4 | R3 | R2 | R1 | R0 | G5 | G4 | G3 | G2 | G1 | G0 | B4 | B3 | B2 | B1 | B0 |

### 2.2 Coordinate system
Coordinate system is controlled by the rotation parameter in the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`

### 2.3 Serial data frame
A single data frame to the display consists of a frame header, instruction, data, CRC (optional) and footer.

The data frame is as such:
| Header | Instruction        | Data                    | CRC (optional) | Footer              |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| `0xAA`   | 1 byte instruction | Up to 248 bytes of data | 2 byte CRC-16/MODBUS | `0xCC 0x33 0xC3 0x3C` |

### 2.4 CRC
CRC can be enabled in the SD card config file `T5UIC1.CFG`. The CRC is a CRC-16/MODBUS.

If any instruction fails the CRC check the device will the following error:

| Instruction | Data |
|-------------|------|
| `0xFF`      | `0x01`|

All device responses will also generate their own CRC.

### 2.4 Instruction set
Below are all the instructions and their corresponding parameters. Every instruction follow the format described in **Serial Data Frame**. If an instruction has an expected response it is **explicitly listed**. All instructions without an expected response described, do not have any response.
